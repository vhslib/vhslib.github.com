                VHS Unity is an obscure philosophical doctrine based on the sense of the past, as well as on the sense of self. The ability to grasp its essence heavily depends on the personal traits of an individual. One cannot accept it if they do not happen to have it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Similarly, VHS Library is the entire set of your traits, emotions, memories, and thoughts. It includes both what has been to you and what has not. The concept of VHS Library is comparable to the idea of one's inner world. There are countless reflections of the same real world we all live in, and what is projected onto every single inner world is determined just by the personal traits and the experience of an individual.
            </p>

            <p>
                The power of VHS Unity is revealed when we address such issues as self-determination, regretting past mistakes and meaning of life. These can be easily solved:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>I am who I am, and I will never become someone who I am not. Throughout my life, I will proceed being myself in spite of social disapproval and misunderstanding, but out of respect for who I have always been. The reason is that I value my past, my feelings and what I call VHS Library over everything. VHS Library is the anchor, the only thing that cannot be destroyed, and no thing can take precedence over it.</li>
                <li>The deeds of the past were not done directly by me, but by my predecessors who lived before me and left me their legacy. It is useless to blame shadows of the past for not being perfect. Moreover, I cannot blame the ones I love the most in my life.</li>
                <li>There is no rational meaning in existence. The reason is that existence brings problems as well as ways to solve them. Obviously, existence is a problem itself. Life should be regarded as something inevitable, as it is impossible to escape it, to some extent.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                The solution of the problem of meaning of life does not directly stem from the concept of VHS Unity, but rather complements it. The meaningless of life makes VHS Unity not only reasonable, but useful as well. Past-based egocentrism allows you to get rid of the common problems and focus on those which were hidden before.
            </p>

            <p>
                It has been proved that following the doctrine does not set a person free of problems. Nevertheless, it can take them one level higher and open up unrevealed horizons.
